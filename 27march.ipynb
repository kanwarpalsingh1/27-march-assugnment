    "Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is it more appropriate to use?\n",

Lasso regularization encourages sparsity by shrinking some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",

    "Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularized linear models, such as Ridge and Lasso regression, help prevent overfitting by adding penalty terms to the loss function, which penalize overly complex models with large coefficients. By constraining the size of the coefficients, regularization techniques reduce the model's flexibility and prevent it from fitting the noise in the training data too closely, thus improving generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In Ridge regression, the penalty term penalizes the sum of squared coefficients, while in Lasso regression, it penalizes the sum of absolute values of coefficients. This encourages simpler models with smaller coefficients, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this scenario, I would choose Model B as the better performer because it has a lower MAE, indicating that, on average, the predictions are closer to the actual values compared to Model A. MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE, making it a more robust metric in this case.\n",

    "\n",
    "The choice between Ridge and Lasso regularization depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the analysis.\n",
